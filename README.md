<h2>How It Works</h2>

Responsive Layout

The project adopts a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS for rapid styling. The layout adjusts dynamically to ensure an optimal user experience across all screen sizes.

Incident Cards

Each incident is displayed as a card that includes important details such as type, description, and status. These cards have hover effects to improve usability and interaction.

Sorting and Filtering

Users can filter incidents by various criteria, such as incident type and date. Sorting options allow incidents to be prioritized based on relevance or recency.

Toast Notifications

After submitting feedback through the interactive form, a toast notification will appear to confirm the successful submission of the feedback.

<h2>Example Output</h2>

When using the dashboard, users can expect:

Incident cards displayed with key details (type, description, and date).

Filter options to narrow down incidents based on various criteria.

Sorting to organize incidents by recency or priority.

Toast notifications confirming the feedback submission.


<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>

Support for Multiple Languages: Add multi-language support for a wider user base.

Enhanced Feedback Form: Allow users to upload files or reports with their feedback.

Database Integration: Store incidents and feedback in a backend database for long-term tracking and analysis.

Authentication: Implement user authentication for submitting feedback and tracking incident reports.
